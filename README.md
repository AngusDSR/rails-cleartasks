# ClearTasks App
This is a Rails application designed to help users turn hurried notes into clear, organized, and time-bound tasks. The app allows users to enter rough notes, which can then be converted into specific tasks and subtasks with deadlines.

## Features
Users can enter rough notes into the app
Notes must be expanded with specific details before they appear in the "Tasks" section
Tasks and subtasks can be created with deadlines
The app supports highlighting impending deadlines and prioritisation
No additional libraries were used - just standard Rails, SCSS, Turbo, Simple_form, and PostgreSQL
### Future Plans
This app is a work in progress, and we hope to add more features in the future. Some potential features we're considering include timeline planning tools and more support for prioritisation.
